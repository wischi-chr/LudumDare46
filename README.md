# ZenTuree
## GameJam - Ludum Dare 46

_Motto:_ Keep it alive

ZenTuree (pronounced a bit like _century_) is a game that combines quite literally _"zen"_, _"tree"_ and _"century"_.
Everything you need to play this game a lot of patience and a green thumb.

### Gameplay
The rules are pretty simple:
1. make sure that your tree has enough water.
2. don't overwater your tree.
3. be patient.
4. keep it alive ;-)

***Tip: You can close the tab, your browser or even shutdown your computer - your tree will continue to grow (as long as it has enough water)***

### Where is my tree?

Keep in mind, that your tree needs about two years to fully grow. Can you keep it alive?

### Technical stuff
You don't need an account. Details about your tree are stored locally (javascript local storage). If you reload the pag, even if a long time has passed, the tree will show the correct state (as if it was "running" the entire time). Actually we just apply the missing time very quickly.

### For Ludum Dare Testers
The normal game mode takes about two years for a full grown tree. To make things simpler there are two test game mode.

#### LD46 Mode
This is the recommended game mode for LD46 testers. A full grown tree takes about 2h and should be watered about every 15 to 30 minutes.

#### No-Zen Mode
For very unpatient players there is an even faster mode. A tree takes about a minute to fully grow.
